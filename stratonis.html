        The vision of <a class="textlink" href="https://stratonis.net/" target="_blank">Stratonis.net</a>  is to provide a responsive, polished experience for viewing Level-2 NEXRAD data in a web application.
    </p>
    <p>
        The motivation for me creating this tool was simply the lack of something like it. There are a couple paid mobile and desktop applications that are excellent, but no good web applications. Most options were cheap, laggy interactive maps, and don't have an option for viewing high resolution data from a single radar. My goal was to create a web application that could read direct data from the radar towers, all while highly focusing on user experience and visual styles.

    Luckily an 
              <a class="textlink" href="https://registry.opendata.aws/noaa-nexrad/" target="_blank">Amazon S3 Bucket exists</a> for downloading radar data. However, it must be converted to a format that is readable in JavaScript maps. The format that I found the best to work with online maps is GeoTIFF raster graphics. <a class="textlink" href="https://registry.opendata.aws/noaa-nexrad/" target="_blank">The NOAA provides software </a> for the conversion to be possible. There are also some <a class="textlink" href=https://github.com/onaci/leaflet-geotiff-2 target="_blank">great libraries</a> for displaying GeoTIFF on leaflet maps. GeoTIFF contains geolocation data, and values within the raster, so custom color scales can be applied.
